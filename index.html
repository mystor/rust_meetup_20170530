          ## Parsing in Rust with `nom`
          #### Michael Layzell

          ## What is a parser?

          note: What is a parser?
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Rust has a parser!

          ```rust
          "10".parse::&lt;i32>() // Ok(10)
          "32.5".parse::&ltf64>() // Ok(32.5)
          "cheese".parse::&lt;i32>() // Err(ParseIntError { ... })
          ```

          What does that look like?

          note: Well, rust has a parser. There's a parse method on `str` which
          you can call to interpret it as one of the primitive data types, like
          i32 or f64.

          Let's use that as a starting place.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Somewhere deep in the standard library...
          ```rust
          impl str {
              fn parse&lt;F>(&self) -> Result&lt;F, F::Err>
                  where F: FromStr { ... }
          }
          ```

          note: This is what that parse method looks like. The basic idea here
          is that the function can take a string in as an argument, and produces
          either structured data, or a result.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ```rust
          fn parse(&str) -> Result&lt;Thing, Err> { ... }
          ```

          > "A parser takes a string, and either returns the parsed value, or an
            error"

          note: If we simplify this down to the minimal definition, this is what
          it looks like.

          This is a relatively limited parser, however. It cannot handle
          interesting cases, such as parsing data off of the beginning of a
          string, and returning the remaining data.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Incremental Parsing?!?

          #### Key-value pairs
          `key: 10`

          #### Delimited lists
          "apple, cider", "pear"

          note: This is important for most interesting parser problems. For
          example, if you have a parser for a word, and a parser for a number,
          you would want to be able to combine them to get a key-value parser.

          It would really suck if you had to write a brand new parser from
          scratch for every combination of numbers, and strings.

          In many of these cases we can't do the easy thing and split on a
          delimiter character either, such as when you want to parse a
          comma-separated list of strings, which might contain commas.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Ta Da!

          ```rust
          fn parse(&str) -> Result&lt;(&str, Thing), Err> { ... }
          ```

          > "A parser takes a string, and either returns the parsed value, and the rest of the string, or an error"

          note: So, we can expand upon the basic parser, and bring it new power!
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Results in `nom`

          ```rust
          enum IResult&lt;I, R> { // * Not actually IResult
              Done(I, R),
              Error,
              Incomplete,
          }
          ```

          note: But nom does something a little bit different. It was designed
          to be as flexible and useful in as many situations as possible, so it
          extracted one of the possible "error" states into a new Result
          variant.

          nom uses `IResult` which is like result, except that it also has
          support for an `Incomplete` case. This is because nom was designed to
          support parsing potentially-incomplete data streams, and needs a way
          to distinguish between a parsing failure due to incorrectly formatted
          data, versus a parsing failure due to simply not having received
          enough data from the stream yet.

          The actual definition of IResult is a bit longer, because nom likes to
          be super fancy, but we can ignore it.

          ## Example Time!

          #### Use the integer32 playground!

          [https://play.integer32.com](https://play.integer32.com)

          #### Or start your own project!

          ```bash
          $ cargo new --bin nomnomnom
          $ cd nomnomnom
          $ echo 'nom = "3.0"' >> Cargo.toml
          $ cargo run
          ```
        </section>
        <section>
          <script type="rust/play">
#[macro_use]
extern crate nom;

// Generates something like:
// fn cool_word(i: &[u8]) -> nom::IResult<&[u8], &[u8]> { ... }
named!(cool_word<&[u8]>, tag!("nom"));

fn main() {
    println!("{:?}", cool_word(b"nom is awesome"));
}
          </script>

          <aside class="notes">
            Parsers in nom are defined using the `named!` macro, which creates a
            function. The generated `cool_word` function has the type signature
            we were talking about before.

            The type in the pointy brackets after the name is the return type.
            By default, parsers take byte arrays, as they are the most generic
            data type. The tag!() parser is a simple parser which checks if the input
            byte array matches the given string, and if it does, consumes it.

fn main() {
    println!("{:?}", cool_word("nom is awesome"));
}
          </script>

          <aside class="notes">
            If we wanted to make this same parser operate on strings instead of
            bytes, we have to specify the input type as well. Fortunately, tag!
            is polymorphic and understands how to operate on &str as well, so we
            don't need to change our parser other than that.

            Changing the parser also changes the result type from tag!(), as tag!() always
            returns a slice of the input.

          <aside class="notes">
            Nom also provides a bunch of different combinators. For example,
            the `many1!` macro takes another parser, and transforms it into a
            parser which calls that parser repeatedly, creating a vec of all of
            the successful parses.

            There's also a many0! combinator which acts like many1! but also
            succeeds if the parser never succeeds, creating an empty Vec.

named!(many_as_or_bs <&str, Vec<char>>,
      alt!(many_as | many_bs));

fn main() {
    println!("{:?}", many_as_or_bs("aaaaaaaples"));
    println!("{:?}", many_as_or_bs("bbbaaaaples"));
}
          </script>

          <aside class="notes">
            Another combinator is alt! parser, which first tries to pass the
            first argument, and then tries to parse the second one.

          <aside class="notes">
            There's also the do_parse! combinator which tries to run a
            series of parsers, optionally bound to variables, sequentially, and
            then compute a final value based on the results of the run parsers. If
            any of the parsers fail the entire parser fails.

          <aside class="notes">
            Sometimes you need to perform a simple transformation on parsed
            data. For example, nom has the `digit` parser, which parses a series
            of base-10 digits.

            We can use this to grab a string representing a number, and parse it
            into an integer.

            map_res is a helper combinator which runs a parser, and then runs a
            function which may return a result, and succeeds the parser if both
            the parser, and the mapping function, succeed.

          <aside class="notes">
            Now we can get into some examples. This first one parses CSV-style
            strings.

            It uses a few of the different parsers we talked about, We look for
            the opening quote, then parse a series of characters, handling the
            escaped double-quote case, followed by the final quote character.

            I should note that this breaks if I write the string literal butting
            up against the end of the string, but explaining why goes into the
            weeds a bit. You can think of figuring out how to fix this parser as
            trivia, or you can bother me and I'll explain it later.

            parses the beginning of a valid ELF executable. As the playpen is
            run on linux, which compiles to ELF binaries, we can actually take a
            look at the ELF header for the generated executable.
